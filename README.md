## Description
Portfolio website showcasing my projects, [visit the site here](https://photkosee.github.io/react-portfolio/)

## Motivation
My drive to create a captivating front-end project for my portfolio stems from a resolute desire to showcase my skills and continuously expand my knowledge in web development. Opting to utilize React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I embarked on this project to immerse myself in these essential technologies. By choosing a soft, inviting theme for the website, I aimed to provide visitors with an engaging experience while spotlighting my previous undertakings. This venture provided a solid foundation in these stacks. </br></br> It allowed me to venture into uncharted territory, integrating swiper.js to craft an innovative slider component â€“ a feat I had not previously encountered. This project symbolizes a strong start in mastering these technologies and my commitment to perpetual growth and ingenuity within the field.
